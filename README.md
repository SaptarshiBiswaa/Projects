# Sample codes:

This folder contains 4 jupyter notebooks and external links containing projects to exemplify my skills related to $Data$ $analysis$, $Data$ $science$ and $Quantitative$ $analysis$. Following are their hyperlinks and brief description.

1. [ML code sample.ipynb](https://github.com/SaptarshiBiswaa/sample_projects/blob/main/ML%20code%20sample.ipynb):

Here I compare two **machine learning models**, $Random$ $Forest$ and $Dense$ $Neural$ $Network$, on a classification problem. Appropriate tuning of hyperparameters and layer configurations is performed to achieve high predictive ability.

2. [python_code_sample.ipynb](https://github.com/SaptarshiBiswaa/sample_projects/blob/main/Python_code_sample.ipynb):

This is a snapshot of the level of intricate **Python coding** I use in my PhD research related to quantum physics problems. The sample code above simulates a twisted bilayer superconductor and determines its quantum energy states. The example shows extensive use of Python packages like $numpy$, $scipy$, plotting, and visualizations using $matplotlib$, as well as foundational coding concepts. *"deltas.npy"* is an input file for this code.

3. [Stock market analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/SaptarshiBiswaa/sample_projects/blob/main/Stock%20market%20analysis.ipynb):

This is an example of **time series forecasting**. Here, the **ARIMA** model is used to predict the stock price of S&P500. The model is composed of 3 components: AutoRegressive (AR), Integrated (I), Moving Average (MA). Historical data of S&P500 stock price is fitted by the model to predict future stock price. We also discuss limitations of the model and quantify that.

4. [sql-code-sample.ipynb](https://github.com/SaptarshiBiswaa/sample_projects/blob/main/sql-code-sample.ipynb):

Here I use **SQL** to query a public dataset on $Bigquery$ from an international census to analyze the growth of female population in India.

5. [Shiny visualization](https://xlf8g9-saptarshi-biswas.shinyapps.io/cars1/): leading to one of my works on **Shiny** data visualization.
