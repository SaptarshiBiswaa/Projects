# Sample codes:

This folder contains 4 jupyter notebooks and external links containing projects to exemplify my skills related to $Data$ $analysis$, $Data$ $science$ and $Quantitative$ $analysis$. Following are their hyperlinks and brief description.

1. [Google data analytics capstone project](https://github.com/SaptarshiBiswaa/google-data-analytics-capstone-project-1) ([certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ORHFBHSEKEV6?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=course))

Executed an end-to-end case study by cleaning, processing, analyzing more than 1 GB data, finding key trends along a given business objective, and creating a polished report and visualization to present to stakeholders.

2. [ML code sample.ipynb](https://github.com/SaptarshiBiswaa/sample_projects/blob/main/ML%20code%20sample.ipynb):

Here I compare two **machine learning models**, $Random$ $Forest$ (ran over $scikit-learn$) and $Dense$ $Neural$ $Network$ (on $Keras$), and find their performance on a classification problem. Appropriate tuning of hyperparameters and layer configurations is done to achieve high predictive ability.

3. [python_code_sample.ipynb](https://github.com/SaptarshiBiswaa/sample_projects/blob/main/Python_code_sample.ipynb):

This is a snapshot of the level of intricate **Python coding** I use in my PhD research related to quantum physics problems. The sample code above simulates a twisted bilayer superconductor and determines its quantum energy states. The example shows extensive use of Python packages like $numpy$, $scipy$, plotting, and visualizations using $matplotlib$, as well as foundational coding concepts. *"deltas.npy"* is an input file for this code.

4. [Stock market analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/SaptarshiBiswaa/sample_projects/blob/main/Stock%20market%20analysis.ipynb):

This is an example of **time series forecasting**. Here, the **ARIMA** model is used to predict the stock price of S&P500. The model is composed of 3 components: AutoRegressive (AR), Integrated (I), Moving Average (MA). Historical data of S&P500 stock price is fitted by the model to predict future stock price. We also discuss limitations of the model and quantify that.

5. [sql-code-sample.ipynb](https://github.com/SaptarshiBiswaa/sample_projects/blob/main/sql-code-sample.ipynb):

Here I use **SQL** to query a public dataset on $Bigquery$ from an international census to analyze the growth of female population in India.

6. [Shiny visualization](https://xlf8g9-saptarshi-biswas.shinyapps.io/cars1/):
  
This is a visualization of a public data about fuel consumption (in miles-per-gallon or, mpg) of cars in a certain city. We want to understand how a car's fuel consumption is related to its build configuration. For that, each car is classified into two categories based on its fuel consumption falling below or, above a threshold. Then, we visualize the category of each car against various aspects of its build.
